### THIS IS YOUR README

Update this file as you go along to record your progress.

I am just getting caught up

I created the flower bush background and the main components

I have added the main components of the clock which is the three main flowers that represent hr/min/sec.

I think the clock looks a little boring so I have added a bunch of little flowers to be the backround to represent the "flower bush".

I have completed the purple flowers as the background.

After some thinking, I will try to make the purple background flowers the alarm feature by making them spin when the alarm goes off.

I have uploaded part one of my sketch. 

After meeting with Phoebe, I have decided to make the background flowers change colour when the alarm is set.

I have also resetted the clock time to be centered on the flowers to make it easier to read.

After tring to get the flowers to change colours when the alarm goes off for a few hours, I have decided to utilise words instead.
